There's snow on the mountains, and fog in the street;
Flickering candles in the room. Hear the churchbell ring
See the children playing. I feel their pure delight
And the snow is falling, taking me away

Cold winter nights, cold winter dreams
Reflecting the sound of my heart; it's my taste of freedom
Cold winter nights, cold winter dreams
Don't try to tear me apart; cold winter dreams
