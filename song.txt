There's snow on the mountains, and fog in the street;
Flickering candles in the room. Hear the churchbell ring
See the children playing. I feel their pure delight
And the snow is falling, taking me away

Cold winter nights, cold winter dreams
Reflecting the sound of my heart; it's my taste of freedom
Cold winter nights, cold winter dreams
Don't try to tear me apart; cold winter dreams


Find myself in peace, warm from underneath
Wish you would be here in this magic scene
I've escaped from reality, dancing in the snow
Cold, blue sky gives me the innocence I need

Cold winter nights, cold winter dreams
Freezing the heat in my heart; it's my taste of freedom
Cold winter nights, cold winter dreams
Chill me and tear me apart; cold winter dreams


The world seemed so clear, like a wonderful diamond
Can't imagine there's meaness. Can't imagine one lie
But when I'm dead and gone and snow's pouring down
I'm burried and covered, peaceful under millions of stars
